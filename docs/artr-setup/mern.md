# The MERN Stack
By *Peter Lu*

We will be following the MERN stack for development. Our technology stack follows MERN because of its ease of use and beginner friendly learning curve for start up businesses.

## What is MERN?

MERN is a popular technology stack used to build efficient and scaleable web applications. MERN stands for 4 main technologies that when put together, creates a full stack application with seemless integration and makes it a popular choice for start ups.

Lets go over each one in a simple definition!

### M
MongoDB is a noSQL database that serves as the database for our entire application.

### E
ExpressJS is lightweight backend web framework that when paired with nodeJS performs client-server communication. It is used to build web applications and APIs

### R
React is a frontend JS library used to develop responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

### N

Nodejs is a javascript runtime enviorment that allows you to run code on the server side, allowing both frontend and backend developers to use the same programming language.

## Why use MERN?

When put together, it creates a powerful tech stack that allows developers to create a fullstack application quickly. 

- MongoDB has flexible data handling
- ExpressJS has lightweight and efficient routing
- ReactJS creates dynamic user interfaces quickly
- NodeJS is a powerful runtime environment


The most important aspect of MERN is that it allows frontend and backend developers to use the same programming language javascript. Javascript has become a universal languages that can communicate between frontend and backend technologies allowing developers to focus on one language most of the time. 

The frontend is made up of **React**. The backend is made up of **ExpressJS** and **NodeJS**. Our database is **MongoDB**.

## Where to start?

As a software engineer for Artr, you are expected to have some experience in full stack development. Our team emphasizes backend programming and we suggest you start of learning how to use MongoDB and perform RESTful approaches during development as soon as possible. 

However, learning frontend is great if you are new to web development and want a more beginner friendly approach compared to backend. Junior software engineers will likely start out developing frontend before transitioning to backend. Backend developers require at least 1 year of experience. 

Here is a comprehensive roadmap for learning the MERN stack:

1. Learn HTML and CSS

These are the building blocks for any frontend developer and understanding the structure of a webpage and how to style using pure css is crucial in developing strong fundementals for creating advanced and engaging user interfaces quickly.  

2. Learn Javascript

Javascript is the most important programming language to learn if you want to be a successful software engineer at Artr. every framework and library in our development pipeline will be javascript. Testing and QA stages will use javascript testing frameworks. Frontend and advanced user interface development will be created using javascript. 

3. Learn React
React will teach you a popular way to develop user interfaces using their component based methodology. React can be used to change data across a site without reloading a page which makes a smooth user experience. Because React is component based, it speeds up frontend development and allows building complex user interfaces easier.

4. Learn Express + Node
Express and Node are used together to allow data to be requested and sent between the web page and server. This is where backend development starts. This is crucial in giving our static web page a way to store and retrive data from and for users. NodeJS is the foundation for building web applications. Without NodeJS it would be a challenge to use javascript on the server side. Javascript was orginally a frontend programming language but thanks to NodeJS, JS has become a more general purpose language for frontend and backend.

5. Learn MongoDB
MongoDB is our database of choice. As a NoSQL database, data is stored in a non tabular and collective fashion. This allows more flexibility and scaleablity for all type of data which is perfect for our platform.
