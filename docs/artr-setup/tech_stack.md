# Technologies

Learn the technologies used in Artr development.

## Introduction

Welcome to Artr's development team! This document will introduce you to our tech stack, the core technology powering our platform. Our stack consists of four main starting technologies: React, Nextjs, MongoDB, Vercel, and Nodejs. This combination offers a powerful and efficient way to build modern web applications, making it ideal for startups like ours.

Our tech stack offers several advantages, particularly for developers new to full-stack development:

- **Simplified Development:** Our stack uses JavaScript throughout the development process, from frontend interfaces to backend logic. This reduces the need to learn multiple programming languages, streamlining development.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Our stack's components encourage rapid prototyping, allowing you to quickly build and test core functionalities.
- **Large Community:** MongoDB benefits from strong support and extensive community resources, providing ample documentation and tools for developers.

### Breaking Down Each Technology

Let's break down each technology within our tech stack:

- **MongoDB (Database):** A popular NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility. MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which allows for dynamic schema design and fast querying, making it a great choice for rapidly growing applications.
- **React (Frontend Library):** A popular library for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React allows for efficient building of complex interfaces and smooth user experiences.
- **NextJS(Fullstack framework)** A fullstack framework that builds on top of react to perform SSR and simplifies the steps towards deployment with Vercel.
- **NodeJS (JavaScript Runtime Environment):** Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server-side. This enables communication between the frontend and backend using a single language.
- **Vercel(Cloud hosting)**: A cloud platform that allows rapid deployment of Nextjs Apps.
- **Docker**(Containerization): A open platform for shipping apps in containers to rapidly test and deploy our product.
- **Prisma**(ORM): A ORM tool used to help developers interact with databases quicker with their desired programming language over raw SQL queries.
- **Redis**: A in-memory database using cache as a durable data store to deliver data at high speeds.
- **AWS Amplify**: A open source framework to accerlate deployment of web applications
- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute function as a service to run code without managing servers.

### Additional Tools and Libraries

- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. TailwindCSS enables rapid styling and consistency across your application.

- **AccernityUI:** A component library designed to work seamlessly with modern web applications, providing pre-built, customizable components to accelerate UI development.

- **Shadcn:** A library that offers a collection of accessible and reusable components, helping developers build consistent and user-friendly interfaces.

- **TailwindUI:** A premium component library built by the creators of TailwindCSS, TailwindUI offers beautifully designed, fully responsive components that can be easily integrated into your projects.

- **ESLint:** A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. ESLint helps maintain code quality and consistency by enforcing coding standards and catching errors early.

- **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter that ensures your code is consistently formatted. Prettier saves time by automating code formatting, making your codebase more readable and maintainable.

- **Jenkins:** An open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment processes, improving software development efficiency.

- **Cypress:** An end-to-end testing framework for web applications. Cypress provides a fast, reliable testing experience with easy setup and powerful features for debugging and test automation.

- **Webpack:** A powerful module bundler for JavaScript applications. Webpack compiles modules with dependencies into static assets, optimizing the performance and organization of your code.

- **Npm:** The Node package manager, which provides access to a vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and tools. Npm simplifies dependency management and facilitates the sharing and reuse of code.

### Technical Skills

Developers are required to have at least 2 years of experience in one of the programming languages and at least 1 year in a query language. Below are all the technical skills you will be utilizing as a developer.

**Programming Languages:**

- **JavaScript:** A versatile programming language commonly used for building dynamic and interactive web applications. JavaScript is essential for both frontend and backend development.

- **Golang:** A statically typed, compiled programming language designed for performance and simplicity. Golang is often used for backend services and system-level programming.

- **C++:** A powerful, high-performance programming language used in system/software development, game development, and applications requiring real-time processing.

- **Python:** A high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and extensive libraries. Python is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

**Query Languages:**

- **SQL:** A standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows for efficient querying, updating, and organizing of structured data.

- **NoSQL:** A category of database management systems designed to handle unstructured data. NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, provide flexible schemas and scalability for large-scale applications.
