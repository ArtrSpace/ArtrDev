# Technologies

Learn the technologies used in Artr development.

**Introduction:**

Welcome to Artr's development team! This document will introduce you to our tech stack, the core technology powering our platform. Our stack consists of four main starting technologies: React, Nextjs, MongoDB, Vercel, and Nodejs. This combination offers a powerful and efficient way to build modern web applications, making it ideal for startups like ours.

**Why Our Tech Stack? Benefits for Beginners**

Our tech stack offers several advantages, particularly for developers new to full-stack development:

- **Simplified Development:** Our stack uses JavaScript throughout the development process, from frontend interfaces to backend logic. This reduces the need to learn multiple programming languages, streamlining development.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Our stack's components encourage rapid prototyping, allowing you to quickly build and test core functionalities.
- **Large Community:** MongoDB benefits from strong support and extensive community resources, providing ample documentation and tools for developers.

**Breaking Down Each Technology**

Let's break down each technology within our tech stack:

- **MongoDB (Database):** A popular NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility. MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which allows for dynamic schema design and fast querying, making it a great choice for rapidly growing applications.
- **React (Frontend Library):** A popular library for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React allows for efficient building of complex interfaces and smooth user experiences.
- **Nextjs(Fullstack framework)** A fullstack framework that builds on top of react to perform SSR and simplifies the steps towards deployment with Vercel.
- **NodeJS (JavaScript Runtime Environment):** Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server-side. This enables communication between the frontend and backend using a single language.

- **Vercel(Cloud hosting)**: A cloud platform that allows rapid deployment of Nextjs Apps.
