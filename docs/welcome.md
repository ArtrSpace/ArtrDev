# Hello from the Artr Dev Team

Hello fellow developer! Welcome to ArtrDev: a documentation website that powers the development of Artr.

## Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

## Only h2 and h3 will be in the TOC by default.

You can configure the TOC heading levels either per-document or in the theme configuration.

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times
