# Get To Know Our Technology Stack

*By Peter Lu*

**Introduction: Building with MERN**

Welcome to Artr's development team! This document will introduce you to the MERN stack, the core technology powering our platform. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This combination offers a powerful and efficient way to build modern web applications, making it ideal for startups like ours.  

**Why MERN? Benefits for Beginners**

MERN offers several advantages, particularly for developers new to full-stack development:

* **Simplified Development:**  MERN uses JavaScript throughout the development process, from frontend interfaces to backend logic. This reduces the need to learn multiple programming languages, streamlining development.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** MERN's components encourage rapid prototyping, allowing you to quickly build and test core functionalities.  
* **Large Community:** MERN boasts a vast developer community, providing extensive resources, tutorials, and forums for troubleshooting and learning.

**Understanding the MERN Stack**

Let's break down each technology within MERN:

* **MongoDB (Database):**  A NoSQL database offering flexibility and scalability for storing various data types used by our platform.
* **Express.js (Backend Framework):**  A lightweight framework for building web applications and APIs on top of Node.js. It handles server-side logic and communication with the database.
* **React.js (Frontend Library):**  A popular library for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React allows for efficient building of complex interfaces and smooth user experiences.
* **Node.js (JavaScript Runtime Environment):**   Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server-side. This enables communication between the frontend and backend using a single language.

**Learning Path for MERN Development**

While MERN offers a beginner-friendly approach, Artr emphasizes backend development. Here's a recommended learning roadmap:

1. **HTML & CSS Fundamentals:**  Grasping these foundational technologies is crucial for building webpages and styling user interfaces.

2. **JavaScript Mastery:**  JavaScript is the cornerstone of MERN. Proficiency in JavaScript is essential for frontend, backend, and testing aspects of development.

3. **React.js for UIs:**  Learn how to build user interfaces using React's component-based approach for efficient and scalable development.

4. **Backend with Express & Node:**  Understand how Express.js and Node.js work together to handle server-side logic, data processing, and communication with the database.

5. **MongoDB for Data Storage:**  Explore MongoDB's functionalities for storing and managing our platform's data in a flexible and scalable manner. 

**Additional Notes**

* Frontend development using React is a great starting point for beginners due to its visual nature. Junior developers may begin with frontend tasks before transitioning to backend development.
* Backend developers typically require at least one year of experience.
