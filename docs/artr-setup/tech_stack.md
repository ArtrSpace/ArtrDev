# Our Start-Up Tech Stack

Learn the technologies used in development.

**Introduction: Building with Our Tech Stack**

Welcome to Artr's development team! This document will introduce you to our tech stack, the core technology powering our platform. Our stack consists of four main starting technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This combination offers a powerful and efficient way to build modern web applications, making it ideal for startups like ours.

**Why Our Tech Stack? Benefits for Beginners**

Our tech stack offers several advantages, particularly for developers new to full-stack development:

- **Simplified Development:** Our stack uses JavaScript throughout the development process, from frontend interfaces to backend logic. This reduces the need to learn multiple programming languages, streamlining development.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Our stack's components encourage rapid prototyping, allowing you to quickly build and test core functionalities.
- **Large Community:** MongoDB benefits from strong support and extensive community resources, providing ample documentation and tools for developers.

**Understanding Our Tech Stack**

Let's break down each technology within our tech stack:

- **MongoDB (Database):** A popular NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility. MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which allows for dynamic schema design and fast querying, making it a great choice for rapidly growing applications.
- **Express.js (Backend Framework):** A lightweight framework for building web applications and APIs on top of Node.js. It handles server-side logic and communication with the database.
- **React.js (Frontend Library):** A popular library for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React allows for efficient building of complex interfaces and smooth user experiences.
- **Node.js (JavaScript Runtime Environment):** Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server-side. This enables communication between the frontend and backend using a single language.

**Learning Path for Our Tech Stack Development**

While our tech stack offers a beginner-friendly approach, Artr emphasizes backend development. Here's a recommended learning roadmap:

1. **HTML & CSS Fundamentals:** Grasping these foundational technologies is crucial for building webpages and styling user interfaces.
2. **JavaScript Mastery:** JavaScript is the cornerstone of our tech stack. Proficiency in JavaScript is essential for frontend, backend, and testing aspects of development.
3. **React.js for UIs:** Learn how to build user interfaces using React's component-based approach for efficient and scalable development.
4. **Backend with Express & Node:** Understand how Express.js and Node.js work together to handle server-side logic, data processing, and communication with MongoDB.
5. **MongoDB for Data Storage:** Explore MongoDB's functionalities for storing and managing our platform's data in a flexible, scalable, and efficient manner.

**Additional Notes**

- Frontend development using React is a great starting point for beginners due to its visual nature. Junior developers may begin with frontend tasks before transitioning to backend development.
- Backend developers typically require at least one year of experience.
