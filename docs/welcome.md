# Hello!

Hey fellow developer! Welcome to ArtrDev: a documentation platform that powers the development for Artr.

### What is ArtrDev?

ArtrDev is a sister platform for Artr specifically for developers. It houses all the documentation, tools, and resources that will help you contribute to platform development. 

To be a developer, you must be a member of the Artr Team. Members of the Artr Team are able to access Artr Dev which is not currently available to the public.

### What can I expect?

As a developer for Artr, you gain access to all resources that will help you follow the development pipeline. All developers are encouraged to contribute documentation and resources to help eachother debug, test, and push features quicker.

### Where should I start?

Begin by familarizing yourself with site navigation with the side navbar(left). All sections are prioritized by development consistency. This means you'll see more important sections that will help you perform rapid development.

A big thanks to the creators of Docusuarus, the react based documention website that powers the development of our platform.
